## Using and Testing Redux with Ionic 3

The proposal of this repo is to find the best way to test a Ionic app using Redux architecture. For that we need to write tones of code, or maybe not so far, we will only discover the true writing code.

I want you to try your own way. Take a look to other branches if you need some inspiration. 

Clone the repo and create a new branch from master. You can create whatever you want the only rule is to make it trough TDD and keep in mind to do short commits in order to others understand what comes first.

¡¡Lucky testing!!
